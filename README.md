# Portfolio

A portfolio for myself made from NestJS and React frameworks using a TypeORM to connect to MySQL.

## Start Up

While this project is currently not public, it may be run locally with a connection to my local database. The frontend and backend must be run seperately.

### Backend

Open a javascript debug terminal and input

```
 cd backend
 npm i

 npm run start:debug
```

### Frontend

Using bash, input

```
 cd frontend
 npm i

 npm start
```
